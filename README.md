# saving_for_college

A look at 2015 data from The College Board. I'm planning to make some kind of Shiny app to allow people to use their own time until the kids go to college, choose the length of time to look back (expecting that linear extrapolation will change noticeably) and the kind of college they have in mind -- 4-year public in-state, out-of-state, or private nonprofit.

I will pitch it at [Analytics Forward](http://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/events/228455037/?rv=ea1).
